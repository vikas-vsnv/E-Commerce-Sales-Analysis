E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains the complete project for an E-commerce Sales Analysis dashboard built with SQL and Power BI. The project analyzes sales data from multiple sources to provide key insights into product performance, customer behavior, and overall business health.

üìä Dashboard Preview
The interactive dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of the sales data. It is composed of three main reports: a general dashboard, a product-focused report, and a customer-focused report.

Customer Demographics: Visualizations for customer distribution by Gender and State.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Collection: Sourced raw data from three separate CSV files: customer_data.csv, orders_data.csv, and product_data.csv.

Data Extraction & Transformation: Used SQL to query the data, perform joins, and aggregate key metrics.

Data Modeling: Loaded the data into Power BI to create a relational model.

DAX Calculations: Developed DAX measures in Power BI to calculate complex KPIs.

Dashboard Development: Designed and built an interactive, multi-page dashboard in Power BI to visualize the insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technology Used
Microsoft Excel: Used for handling the initial CSV data files.

SQL: The primary language used for querying and aggregating the data from the source files.

Power BI: The core tool for data modeling, DAX measure creation, and building the final interactive dashboard.

Power Query: Used within Power BI for data cleaning and transformation (ETL).

üìù SQL Queries
Below are some of the key SQL queries used to extract and aggregate the data for the dashboard.

Total Sales by Category
SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(o.order_quantity * p.price) AS Total_Sales
FROM
    orders AS o
JOIN
    products AS p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.category
ORDER BY
    Total_Sales DESC;

Total Sales by Zone
SELECT
    c.zone,
    SUM(o.order_quantity * p.price) AS Total_Sales
FROM
    customers AS c
JOIN
    orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN
    products AS p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    c.zone;

Top 10 Products by Revenue
SELECT
    p.name,
    SUM(o.order_quantity) AS Total_Orders,
    SUM(o.order_quantity * p.price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM
    products AS p
JOIN
    orders AS o ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.name
ORDER BY
    Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
